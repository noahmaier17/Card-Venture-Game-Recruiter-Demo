 == TODO BUGS ==

Does Purge correctly remove triggers?

Add text for when a looting instance is skipped
 - Text apparently exists for shops already

Add signifier to the number for selecting a card if <<inoperable>> (like BLACK)

Add more Karkit Cards

Change shell text to clearly be shell text
 - EG: use a > for when text of a card has been modified

Implement handleDuplicateCMF

Magical Counter Weight Bugs
 - Need to be able to modify the chance value of the trigger

Broken static trigger texts
 - These need to be able to be mutated, otherwise they do not work
 - EG: If you shell a card with a trigger, the card name shown by that trigger is not updated.

Implement Functional "+ Cantrip. For This Turn, all Chance Values are 0.8."
 - I can have a duringPlay call that changes all cards in Deck and the way in which onGain works to be with chance_modifyChance. At LAST of Turn End, invisibly undo this chance_modifyChance.
 - I could reword the effect: 
	+ Cantrip. This Turn, when you Play a Card: 
	(1) Before Resolution, change its Chance values to 0.85.
	(2) After Resolution, undo that change.
 - --> This can have a problem with already-existing chance_modifyChance instances. Instead of having a global handleDuplicateCMF, I can have a case-wise duplicate handler.

 - Additional but same-functionality reword:
	+ Cantrip. This Turn, when you Play a Card, for the Duration of its Resolution, change its Chance values to 0.85.
 - If something else changes this' Chance values during this trigger, we need to manually assign its resolution. We can handle that with a After Resolution trigger! 
 - - - - If we are going to go this route, I think it would be nice to have an automatic trigger resolver for things that do not need resolving otherwise (like with Dominion). A Card like this does not need to create a window unless there are other triggers. I could do this the simplest route, where upon 2+ triggers they are ordered per the player's discretion.
