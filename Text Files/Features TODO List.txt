Add Tier 0 clearing which gives damage-dealing Heirlooms
 - Could be per character or a global set of cards
 - Per character seems neater

OR, make it so you loot a clearing and then fight. That would maybe make for a more instantly-gratifying gameplay loop and make building deck easier to do. 


TRIGGER REWORK:

I need to make it so triggers can easily be removed. They need information about how they are connected to the card:
 1. Play Text
 2. Throw Text
 3. Dollar Sign
 4. etc.

I also need triggers to be stored in a way where card modifications can modify them. 

FOR STATIC TRIGGERS:
 - These need a way to be accessed. I could just have an array list for them with 1 element. 
FOR DYNAMIC TRIGGERS: 
 - This needs special care taken with it, since we need to decide if our cmf altered the condition of the text. 

CMF GRANULARITY:
 - PERMANENT
	Changes a Card or Entity for forever (barring another mutation :P). 
 - TURN(S)
	Changes a Card or Entity for a while. 
	Overrides PERMANENT changes. 
 - NEXT
	Changes a Card for simply the next instances. 
	Overrides PERMANENT changes.
	React Window for choosing if the TURN(S) or NEXT trigger resolves.
